## Carl Van Vechten Exhibition Website

The `src` folder contains the code and assets for the interactive touch screen exhibit.

The `Dockerfile` has been added to aid in wrapping the website in a nginx-based Docker container image. Details on creating and deploying a Docker image to the AWS cloud are available in this project's wiki.

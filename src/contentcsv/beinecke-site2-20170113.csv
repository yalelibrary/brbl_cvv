1,18,Grace Nail Johnson,01gnjohnson.jpg,b01gnjohnson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten December 3, 1932</i><br><br> Today, Grace Nail Johnson is best known as the wife of James Weldon Johnson. She was, however, a powerful advocate for social change in her own right. Like her husband, Johnson was committed to encouraging African American writers and artists and to supporting research in African American culture. <br> <br> The daughter of a wealthy and well-respected New York family, Grace Nail met her future husband when she was a teenager. After they married in 1910, Grace Johnson joined her husband at his diplomatic post in Corinto, Nicaragua. The people of Corinto welcomed her with an unusual gift—a yellow parrot named LuLu. She kept the pet for the rest of her life. LuLu, in fact, outlived Johnson by some twenty years. <br> <br> The Johnsons became central figures of the Harlem Renaissance. Grace Johnson was a celebrated hostess, entertaining the African American political and artistic elite. In addition, she supported a number of important civil rights groups, fighting for equal job opportunities for men and women of color, and for equal pay for African American workers. Due to her valuable work, high profile, and generous spirit, Johnson became a mentor to many younger African American women. <br> <br> When James Weldon Johnson was killed in a car accident in 1938, Grace Johnson continued to promote the ideal of social justice to which he had dedicated his life. As a result of her work, many schools, community centers, and housing complexes bear his name. In support of Carl Van Vechten’s idea to memorialize James Weldon Johnson by establishing a research center, she made a gift of her husband’s papers to Yale University to establish the James Weldon Johnson Memorial Collection of Negro Arts and Letters."
2,22,Claude McKay,02mckay.jpg,b02mckay.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten July 25, 1941</i><br><br> The writer and activist Claude McKay considered himself “a vagabond with a purpose.” The phrase aptly evokes the exploratory sensibility that pervaded his life and work. A key Harlem Renaissance figure, he spent little actual time in Harlem, preferring instead to travel the world. Born in Sunny Ville, Jamaica in 1889, McKay first visited the United States in 1912, and also lived in Holland, Belgium, France, the Soviet Union, and Morocco over the course of his adventurous life.<br><br>McKay’s transnational travels informed his politics. He had a deep sense of solidarity with people of African descent around the world, and developed an interest in Communism in the early 1920s (although he never committed fully to the ideology). His politics, in turn, shaped his art. McKay’s 1919 poem “If We Must Die,” which J. A. Rogers called the “Negro Marseillaise,” stands as one of the iconic literary works of the Renaissance. The poem is a call to action: <br><blockquote>If we must die, let it not be like hogs<br>Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot…<br>Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack<br>Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!</blockquote> In addition to poetry, McKay also wrote novels, short stories, and essays. While critical reception of these works was largely positive, it was not unanimous: W. E. B. Du Bois famously wrote of McKay’s novel <i>Home to Harlem</i> that it “for the most part nauseates me, and after the dirtier parts of its filth I feel distinctly like taking a bath.” After McKay’s death in 1948, his reputation declined somewhat due to the explicitly activist nature of his art – he disdained the idea “that Negroes in literature and art should be decorous and decorative” – and his radical politics. Today, however, he is recognized as one of the era’s most significant voices. "
3,7,John W. Bubbles,03bubbles.jpg,b03bubbles.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten December 27, 1935</i><br><br>John Sublett, better known by his stage name John W. Bubbles, was a tap dancer, singer, and vaudeville star. He began performing as a child in Louisville, Kentucky. When he met Ford Lee Washington in 1915, the two (both still teenagers at the time) formed a vaudeville duo known as “Bubbles and Buck.” Within a few years, they secured a coveted engagement at the Palace Theatre, the most famous stage in New York City vaudeville. Their stature allowed them to bypass the grueling Theater Owners’ Booking Association (or T.O.B.A.) circuit on which most black vaudevillians toured. Instead, Bubbles and Buck performed at theaters across the country that typically featured only white artists – including Radio City Music Hall, where they became the venue’s first African American performers. They earned up to $1,750 per week, one of the highest salaries in the business. <br><br>Bubbles pioneered the rhythm style of tap dance. He dropped his heels on the offbeats, used his toes to accent syncopations, and lengthened rhythmic patterns beyond the typical eight-bar phrase. These innovations set him apart from other dancers of the day, who tended to dance on their toes and stay within the confines of short musical phrases. He often improvised his breathtakingly complex dances, a practice which amazed his audiences and vexed dancers who sought to copy his steps. <br><br>In 1935, George Gershwin offered Bubbles the part of Sportin’ Life in the premiere of <i>Porgy and Bess</i> (Buck Washington was also in the cast, playing the role of Mingo). The role made him even more of a star, and he went on to perform with Judy Garland, Bob Hope, and others. In 1967, Bubbles suffered a stroke that left him partially paralyzed, but he continued to make occasional appearances. He died in 1986 at his southern California home.   "
4,6,William Stanley Braithwaite,04braithwaite.jpg,b04braithwaite.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten March 27, 1947</i><br><br>In <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i>, James Weldon Johnson declared William Stanley Braithwaite “unique among all the Aframerican writers the United States has yet produced” and proclaimed that “no future study of American poetry of this age can be made without reference to Braithwaite.” Johnson’s confidence may have been misplaced. Many such “future stud[ies]” have neglected Braithwaite because he chose not to foreground race in his literary work, unlike many other Harlem Renaissance-era poets. His myriad accomplishments, however, render him as an influential figure in African American letters. <br><br>Braithwaite was born in Boston in 1878; his father was from the West Indies and his mother was the descendant of slaves. After leaving school at age 12, he became a publisher’s apprentice and developed an interest in poetry. He published his first volume of poems, <i>Lyrics of Life and Love</i>, in 1904. Strongly influenced by British traditions, Braithwaite’s poetry makes use of conventional forms like the sonnet and deals with Romantic themes. <br><br>Braithwaite was also an editor, critic, and anthologist. In 1905, he was appointed literary critic at the <i>Boston Evening Transcript</i>, a position he held for more than two decades. Beginning in 1921, he published an annual <i>Anthology of Magazine Verse</i> that promoted poets from Sterling Brown and Langston Hughes to Edgar Lee Masters and Carl Sandburg. If his fellow black poets were sometimes skeptical of Braithwaite’s decision not to focus on race and racialized subjects, he was equally skeptical of their work, which he considered “caught between the currents of the poetry of protest and the poetry of expression.” He remained convinced that the future of black American poetry lay in its aspirations toward universalism, and urged black poets to “write about the Negro without the surrender or compromise of the artist’s vision.”"
5,11,W. E. B. Du Bois,05dubois.jpg,b05dubois.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten July 18, 1946</i><br><br>W. E. B. Du Bois is a towering figure in African American history. A scholar, writer, and activist, he was a leading advocate for racial justice within and beyond the United States. Born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in 1868, Du Bois studied at Fisk University and the University of Berlin before receiving his Ph.D. from Harvard. From 1898 to 1910, he taught sociology at Atlanta University. <br><br>“The problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-line,” Du Bois declared in his early masterpiece, <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i> (1903). It was an insight that would serve as an organizing principle for his diverse intellectual output. Unlike other black thinkers, notably Booker T. Washington, Du Bois rejected the idea that assimilation could lead to true success for African Americans, and called instead for full and equal citizenship. In another major work, <i>Black Reconstruction</i> (1935), he argued that enslaved people effectively freed themselves during the Civil War. Du Bois put his theories into practice as a political leader. He was instrumental to the founding of the Niagara Movement and its successor, the NAACP. He was also deeply involved in black internationalism, helping to lead Pan-Africanist Congresses from 1900 to 1945. <br><br>To Du Bois, art and politics were profoundly connected. In a 1926 essay, he famously argued that “All art is propaganda and ever must be,” and that art and the world around it are “unseparated and inseparable.” Accordingly, his own novels, short stories, pageants and plays expand upon the themes of his political work. Concomitantly, though, his taste for high culture and glorification of the Talented Tenth (his term for a class of exceptional artists and intellectuals) led some to accuse him of elitism. <br><br>As he became disillusioned with the moderate stance and slow pace of civil rights activism in the United States, Du Bois became increasingly radical. He was unintimidated by the U.S. government’s unsuccessful attempts to deny him a passport, and traveled extensively throughout the Soviet Union, Europe, and China, finally settling in Ghana after joining the Communist Party in 1961. His death, in August 1963, came on the eve on the March on Washington – a powerful symbol of his role in the enduring struggle for civil rights.  "
6,17,Zora Neale Hurston,06hurston.jpg,b06hurston.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten April 3, 1935</i><br><br>The author of novels, short stories, scholarly studies of African American, Haitian, and Jamaican folklore, and autobiographical writing, Zora Neale Hurston is among the most celebrated writers of the Harlem Renaissance. Hurston’s warmth and charm, along with her vibrant personality, made her one of the best-liked members of the 1920s Harlem literary elite. That Hurston gave this set the sobriquet “niggerati” is evidence of her considerable wit. <br><br>Raised in the all-black town of Eatonville, Florida, Hurston moved north in her early thirties, though she told new acquaintances she was in her early twenties. She spent a year at Howard University studying with Alain Locke before going on to Barnard College, where she also studied anthropology and folklore. After completing her bachelor’s degree, Hurston received a grant to travel throughout the South studying African American folk traditions. This research led to numerous scholarly articles and the book <i>Mules and Men</i>. Hurston also incorporated her research into her novels, <i>Jonah’s Gourd Vine</i> (1934) and <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> (1937). She wrote dramatic pieces, too, and contributed to African American revues. She collaborated briefly with Langston Hughes on a play, <i>Mule Bone</i>. The project led to a deep conflict between the two writers and wasn’t produced until 1991, when it played at the Lincoln Center Theater in New York. Carl Van Vechten wrote of Hurston, with whom he shared a close friendship, “Zora is picturesque, witty, electric, indiscreet, and unreliable. The latter quality offers material for discussion; the former qualities induce her friends to forgive and love her.” <br><br>Hurston returned to Eatonville toward the end of her life. She withdrew from the literary scene and worked as a domestic in the home of a white family. She died in Eatonville in relative obscurity. Hurston’s work returned to popularity in the 1970s in large part through the efforts of African American writers and scholars."
7,2,Josephine Baker,07baker.jpg,b07baker.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten October 20, 1949</i><br><br>“I improvised, crazed by the music…[in] the scorching eye of the spotlights.” Josephine Baker’s words refer to her sensational dancing, but the sentiment applies to her life writ large. In a society hostile to black women’s success, Baker improvised an artistic persona and a complex life. Throughout, she was the perpetual subject of intense scrutiny. <br><br> Born Freda Josephine McDonald in St. Louis in 1906, Baker began her career in the United States, where she toured with vaudeville troupes and joined the chorus of <i>Shuffle Along</i>. Upon moving to Paris in 1925, she ascended to stardom. In <i>La Revue Nègre</i>, she shimmied, kicked, mugged, clowned, and slid her way through her signature <i>danse sauvage</i>. In live performances and the film <i>La folie du jour</i>, she danced in her infamous banana skirt, accompanied by black male drummers and gazed at by largely white audiences After touring 25 countries in 1928 and 1929, Baker shifted her focus to jazz; she sang and starred in musical comedies during the 1930s.  Her reputation exemplified the paradox of celebrity and subjection faced by many early-twentieth-century black entertainers: Baker attained significant economic and social power – she earned a fortune and was among the most photographed women in the world – but her performances also enabled audiences to project sexualized, primitivist fantasies onto her body. <br><br>Baker was also an antiracist activist. She joined the French resistance during World War II, and later visited the United States as an advocate for civil rights. Between 1954 and 1962, she adopted the 12 children of her “Rainbow Tribe,” whom she considered a living example of multiracial democratic harmony. Vibrant and complex, Baker remained an icon throughout her life; in the words of Ernest Hemingway, she was “the most sensational woman anybody ever saw. Or ever will.” "
8,9,Countée Cullen,08cullen.jpg,b08cullen.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten June 20, 1941</i><br><br>The details of Countée Cullen’s early life are murky. He was born in either New York City or Louisville or Baltimore, and he may or may not have been adopted by the Methodist reverend Frederick A. Cullen. Cullen’s literary talent, however, was never in question. When he published his first collection of poetry, <i>Color</i>, at the age of 22, critics responded with copious praise. Alain Locke wrote: “Ladies and Gentlemen! A genius! Posterity will laugh at us if we do not proclaim him now.” <br><br>After receiving degrees from New York University and Harvard, Cullen became a well-respected poet. He amassed multiple poetry prizes, a Guggenheim fellowship, and widespread popularity. A’Lelia Walker, the Harlem heiress to a hair-products fortune, was inspired to name her famous literary salon “The Dark Tower” after one of Cullen’s poems. <br><br> In 1928, Cullen married Yolande Du Bois, the daughter of W. E. B. Du Bois. Their wedding was a highlight of the Harlem social calendar, but the marriage was a disaster that lasted not even two years. Cullen’s second marriage, to Ida Roberson, was more successful. Cullen and his best friend, Harold Jackman, also seem to have been lovers, and Cullen was likely part of the Harlem Renaissance’s underground yet expansive queer community. <br><br> As a poet, Cullen was interested in universal themes and skeptical of aesthetic frameworks that pigeonholed black poets by pandering to the primitivist expectations of white audiences. As he wrote in the introduction to an anthology he edited, <i>Caroling Dusk</i>, “The attempt to corral the outbursts of the ebony muse into some definite mold to which all poetry by Negroes will conform seems altogether futile and aside from the facts.” He also had a charming affection for cats: each of the children’s books he wrote (which are mostly about animals) listed his feline coauthor as Mr. Christopher Cat."
9,5,Arna Bontemps,09bontemps.jpg,b09bontemps.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten August 13, 1939</i><br><br>A poet, novelist, anthologist, editor, and librarian, Arna Bontemps was a prolific and influential figure in African American letters. A friend to many Harlem Renaissance writers, he was embedded in the movement’s close-knit literary and intellectual networks.<br><br> Born in Louisiana, Bontemps grew up in Los Angeles and moved to Harlem after graduating from college. He quickly racked up poetry prizes from <i>Opportunity</i> and <i>The Crisis</i>, and befriended Langston Hughes, who would become a lifelong collaborator. In 1931, he moved to Huntsville, Alabama with his wife, Alberta Johnson, and their six children. There, he taught at Oakwood Junior College and continued to write. Many of his short stories from this period center on Southern themes and locales, and he was asked to ghostwrite fellow Alabamian W. C. Handy’s autobiography, <i>Father of the Blues</i>. Yet Bontemps also faced racially motivated hostility in the South; in later years, he would claim that he left Alabama after refusing an order to burn his copies of politically potent books by James Weldon Johnson, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Frederick Douglass. Shortly after leaving Alabama in 1936, Bontemps published the critically acclaimed <i>Black Thunder</i>, a historical novel about a Virginia slave rebellion that remains his best-known work. <br><br> Bontemps’s work as a librarian and archivist had perhaps even more of a lasting impact. After receiving a master’s degree in library science in 1943, he took a job as a librarian at Fisk University. He worked as head librarian at Fisk until 1964; under his guidance, the library became a key repository of African American culture. From 1969 to 1971, Bontemps served as a curator of the James Weldon Johnson Memorial Collection at Yale. He died suddenly in 1973, leaving behind a substantial literary legacy."
10,26,William Grant Still,10still.jpg,b10still.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten March 12, 1949</i><br><br>William Grant Still stands among the most celebrated of early-twentieth-century African American composers. Born in Mississippi in 1895, Still grew up in Arkansas and attended Wilberforce University before moving to New York to pursue a musical career. As a young professional musician, he explored myriad stylistic milieus: he played in the pit orchestra for <i>Shuffle Along</i>, arranged tunes for W. C. Handy and Paul Whiteman, and studied under an array of mentors who included New England traditionalist George Chadwick and French modernist Edgar Varèse. <br><br> Still’s creative output was far more varied than is conveyed by his most frequently performed works. His famous <i>Afro-American Symphony</i> (1934), for instance, emphasizes recognizably “black” idioms and represents one of his more conservative compositions. But his lesser-known works demonstrate more fully the scope of his compositional voice, particularly his experimental willingness to venture outside racially marked styles and incorporate various modernist and Americanist tropes into his work. These include his nine operas, which range from <i>Troubled Island</i>, a dramatization of the Haitian Revolution (for which Langston Hughes provided a libretto) to <i>Highway 1, U.S.A.</i>, the tale of an American family running a gas station in the South during the 1940s. <br><br> Still received abundant honors for his work, including a Harmon Award and fellowships from the Guggenheim and Roosevelt foundations. Orchestras around the world have performed his compositions. He was also the first black composer to have his work performed by a major American opera company, as well as the first African American conductor of a major symphony orchestra. Yet despite his own successes, he remained frustrated with the relative lack of support afforded to black artists in general, and devoted much of his later career to advocating for more robust support of African American music."
11,21,Fania Marinoff,11marinoff.jpg,b11marinoff.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten April 18, 1932</i><br><br> Fania Marinoff spent much of her life in the shadow of her husband, Carl Van Vechten. Though she had an extraordinary sense of drama and a great deal of flair, she was sometimes eclipsed by Van Vechten’s larger-than-life personality. Yet Marinoff was a woman of achievement in her own right. <br><br> Marinoff was born in Odessa to Russian Jews, the thirteenth child in her family. After her mother’s death, the family moved to Boston. At the age of 12, Marinoff joined a small traveling theatrical company. When the company folded, leaving her stranded in Nebraska, Marinoff had the good fortune to meet a well-known actress named Blanche Walsh. Walsh brought Marinoff to New York, where she earned increasingly important roles with notable theater companies. When Marinoff met a theater critic named Carl Van Vechten, their attraction was mutual and immediate. After a passionate courtship, they married in 1914. Marinoff continued to perform on stage and screen, including an appearance as Ariel in a very successful 1916 production of <i>The Tempest</i>.<br><br> Though Van Vechten had a number of male lovers throughout his life, husband and wife remained emotionally committed for over 40 years. Each drew considerable strength from the love and devotion of the other, but they were prone to public scenes and volatile discussions – though often these dissolved into affectionate exchanges of pet names. Because they were apart periodically while Marinoff toured, they exchanged a great many letters. In 1921, Van Vechten wrote, “Dearest Baby Marinoff, I was so blue yesterday that I nearly died; it seems so silly to be here and you there; I missed you so much and everything went wrong.” Many of Van Vechten’s letters to his wife read like those of a newlywed who can’t bear to be separated from his bride, even those written after decades of marriage."
12,15,Georgette Harvey,12harvey.jpg,b12harvey.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten May 23, 1932</i><br><br> Actress and singer Georgette Harvey once claimed to have written a memoir titled <i>Soap Suds to Champagne</i>. Unfortunately, the text has never been located – but it is safe to say that its contents would be fascinating. Harvey was a larger-than-life figure, a talented performer made famous by escapades and accomplishments alike. <br.<br> Born in St. Louis in 1882, Harvey left home at age 20 to sing with Ernest Hogan’s musical comedy show <i>Rufus Rastus</i>. She launched a vaudeville troupe, the Creole Bells, two years later. Under Harvey’s management, the group toured Europe, performing in bars and nightclubs across England, France, Germany, and Russia. Around 1911, most of the troupe headed home, while Harvey stayed on in St. Petersburg. She lived there until the Russian Revolution forced her east to Siberia, Shanghai, and Tokyo. <br><br> Upon returning to the United States in 1920, Harvey established a successful career. She recorded for Black Swan Records and performed in Sissle and Blake’s <i>Runnin’ Wild</i> (1923). She starred in the acclaimed leftist Theater Union production of <i>Stevedore</i> in 1934; in 1939, she performed alongside Ethel Waters and Fredi Washington in <i>Mamba’s Daughters</i>, and in 1949 she joined the original Broadway cast of Kurt Weill’s <i>Lost in the Stars</i>. <br><br> Harvey’s most iconic role was that of Maria in <i>Porgy and Bess</i>. She originated the part in Dubose and Dorothy Heyward’s 1927 play <i>Porgy</i>, and took it on again in the Gershwins’ opera (in both the 1935 premiere and the 1942 revival). By 1943, she was known as the “Grand Old Lady” of the show, lauded for her showmanship and dedication: one critic admiringly noted that for Harvey, “every rehearsal is a performance.” Harvey herself attributed her accomplishments to lifelong hard work. “There’s only one way to a successful theatrical career,” she told a reporter, “and that’s the hard way, if [you] want to stay on top.”"
13,14,W. C. Handy,13handy.jpg,b13handy.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten May 24, 1932</i><br><br> William Christopher Handy, the musician and composer known as the “Father of the Blues,” was born in Florence, Alabama in 1873. His parents were both freed slaves. After working briefly as a schoolteacher and in an iron mill, Handy joined a minstrel troupe, Mahara’s Minstrels, with whom he toured Chicago, the American South, and Cuba. It was while on tour with Mahara’s Minstrels in rural Clarksdale, Mississippi that Handy first heard the Mississippi Delta blues. His first impression was that it was “the weirdest music I had ever heard.” His second thought was that “there was money to be made, and who were we to turn up our noses?” <br><br> Around 1906, Handy moved to Memphis, where he wrote his first two hits: “The Memphis Blues” (originally a campaign song for a mayoral candidate) and the wildly popular “St. Louis Blues.” While in Memphis, Handy also partnered with the African American banker Harry H. Pace to form a publishing company. Their burgeoning venture moved to New York City in 1917. Handy recalled in his autobiography that in New York he encountered “the beast of racial prejudice” in an industry dominated by white publishers. Nonetheless, his prime New York location enabled him to popularize the blues on a national scale. <br><br> Like many of his Harlem Renaissance contemporaries, Handy was a dedicated anthologist. His <i>Blues: An Anthology</i> (1926), a landmark text, detailed the influence of the blues on jazz, popular song, and classical music. He also published a <i>Collection of Negro Spirituals</i> in 1929. Lauded for his substantial contributions during his lifetime, Handy has continued to generate widespread admiration and acclaim, and a blues museum now graces his Alabama hometown. "
14,16,Roland Hayes,14hayes.jpg,b14hayes.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten January 29, 1954</i><br><br> Roland Hayes rose to international prominence as a concert singer of extraordinary talent. The son of freed slaves from Georgia, Hayes fell in love with opera after hearing a recording of Enrico Caruso. Following a stint with the Fisk Jubilee Singers, he moved to Boston, where, in 1917, he paid $400 out of pocket to rent Symphony Hall for a solo vocal recital. Despite the racist protestations of many white Bostonians, Hayes’s debut was a resounding success: not only was the hall sold out, but hundreds of would-be concertgoers were turned away at the door. In 1923, he performed at Symphony Hall again as the first African American to sing with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Hayes’s voice would eventually take him across the Atlantic, and he became a sought-after performer across Europe. He also toured extensively in the United States (although Southern venues initially refused to book him) with pianist Lawrence Brown. By 1924, Hayes’s annual income approached $100,000, making him one of the most highly paid musicians on the international stage. <br><br> Like many African American concert singers of the era, Hayes often sang spirituals as well as art songs, particularly when performing for white audiences. According to James Weldon Johnson, he sang them exquisitely: <br><blockquote> Through the genius and supreme artistry of Roland Hayes these songs undergo, we may say, a transfiguration. He takes them high above the earth and sheds over them shimmering sliver of moonlight and flashes of the sun's gold; and we are transported as he sings. </blockquote>Whether singing Schubert or the sorrow songs, Hayes’s voice exuded warmth, subtlety and polish. Never one to revel in his own celebrity, he became a mentor to the next generation of concert singers, including Marian Anderson, with whom he enjoyed a lasting friendship. "
15,13,Taylor Gordon,15gordon.jpg,b15gordon.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten March 18, 1933</i><br><br> Taylor Gordon grew up far from Harlem in White Sulphur Springs, Montana. When circus impresario John Ringling visited the town, Gordon became a porter on Ringling’s private railroad car. Eventually, he made his way to Harlem. <br><br> Gordon was an outstanding singer, and in 1925, he and J. Rosamond Johnson embarked on an international recital tour to promote <i>The Book of American Negro Spirituals</i>. Renowned for his talent, Gordon was also a legendary host. Gerri Major wrote of a party he gave: <br><blockquote> What a crowd! All classes and colors met face to face, ultra aristocrats, Bourgeois, Communists, Park Avenuers galore, bookers, publishers, Broadway celebs, and Harlemites giving each other the once over… Gus Simons, the Harlem crooner, made the River Stay Away From His Door and Taylor himself brought out everything from “Hot Dog” to “Bravo” when he made high C. </blockquote> Gordon’s autobiography <i>Born to Be</i> (1929) secured his star in the Harlem Renaissance firmament. Featuring a foreword by Carl Van Vechten and illustrations by Miguel Covarrubias, the book recounts Gordon’s Montana childhood and musical career. Most critics admired Gordon’s colloquial style and distinctive portrait of black life in the American West, but a review in <i>The Crisis</i> derided the book as “another product of the Van Vechten school of Negro literature.” “I get the impression,” the anonymous critic wrote, “that Taylor is ‘cutting up’ for the white folk…here there is scarce a serious word.” <br><br> Toward the end of <i>Born to Be</i>, Gordon reminisces that while life in Harlem is “one thrill after another,” he longs “to go back to the mountains, surround myself with wine, women and song, and spend the rest of my days.” This is more or less what he did. After a few other artistic ventures – he appeared in the film <i>The Emperor Jones</i> and wrote a novel – Gordon returned to Montana in 1959."
16,8,Cab Calloway,16calloway.jpg,b16calloway.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten January 12, 1933</i><br><br> Nicknamed “The Hi De Ho Man” after his signature song, Cab Calloway was one of the most famous African American musicians of the 1930s and 1940s. His parents, middle-class professionals in Baltimore, hoped that he would become a lawyer like his father. But Calloway’s early talent for music blossomed into a professional ambition, and he dropped out of law school to sing with a band called the Alabamians. <br><br> By 1931, Calloway had moved on to a rival group called the Missourians, which soon became the house band at the Cotton Club in Harlem. At first, the group (now known as the Calloway Orchestra) alternated nights with Duke Ellington’s band. When they became the club’s preferred entertainers, they were catapulted to fame. The Calloway Orchestra reached a national audience via regular radio broadcasts, toured the United States and Europe, and even appeared in movies. Their success had a ripple effect, bolstering the reputation of black and white swing bands across the country. <br><br> A consummate performer, Calloway delighted audiences with his stylish outfits, unabashed bravado, and high-spirited stage presence. In his best-known song, the 1931 tune “Minnie the Moocher,” Calloway would call out a phrase – sometimes the “hi-de-hi-de-hi-de-hi” that gave him his nickname, sometimes a variant like “skip-de-diddly-diddly-oh” – and his band and audience would respond in kind. The song’s popularity inspired George Gershwin to model the character of Sportin’ Life in <i>Porgy and Bess</i> after Calloway. <br><br> Mainstream musical tastes eventually shifted away from the big-band style that Calloway popularized, and his band broke up in 1948. But Calloway continued to perform, in various contexts, for years to come. He could never stay away from the stage: as he put it, “My audience was my life. What I did and how I did it, was all for my audience.”"
17,25,Bessie Smith,17smith.jpg,b17smith.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten February 3, 1936</i><br><br> Orphaned as a little girl, Bessie Smith joined a vaudeville company when still a child. During a performance, legendary blues singer “Ma” Rainey discovered her. Intriguing rumors surround their meeting—“legend has it that Ma Rainey literally kidnapped Bessie, that she and her husband forced the girl to tour with their show,” and some accounts suggest that the two women became lovers. There is little evidence to support the kidnapping or love affair, but Rainey did invite Smith to join her show; she taught Smith the music business and helped develop her voice and performance style. In this way the “Mother of the Blues” launched the career of the “Empress of the Blues.” They remained lifelong friends. <br><br> For the next decade, Smith performed in tent shows all over the United States. Her relentless touring helped her develop a wide following. Her first record, made in 1923, sold almost 800,000 copies, and she made nearly 80 more records before 1930. Throughout the 1920s, she earned more money than any other African American entertainer. <br><br> Smith had a large personality and a raunchy sense of humor. Her first marriage, to a Philadelphia police officer named Jack Gee, was volatile and often violent. In response, Smith turned to alcohol, and to various lovers, both men and women. Her career slowed down in the 1930s; she struggled to update her style in light of the new jazz and swing craze. <br><br> Smith died at the age of 50 after a car accident. Her death, like much of her life, remains shrouded in rumor. Some say a doctor at the scene abandoned Smith to treat a white couple. Others suggest that Smith bled to death in the ambulance on the long drive to a hospital that treated African Americans. It has been suggested, too, that Smith was refused treatment at a nearby white hospital."
18,23,Bill Robinson,18robinson.jpg,b18robinson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten January 25, 1933</i><br><br> “No dancer ever developed the art of tap dancing to a more delicate perfection,” Langston Hughes reminisced, “creating little running trills of rippling softness or terrific syncopated rolls of mounting sound, rollicking little nuances of tip-tap-toe, or staccato runs like a series of gunshots.” The subject of his praise was Bill Robinson, the most renowned African American tap dancer of the twentieth century. <br><br> Born Luther Robinson and nicknamed “Bojangles,” Robinson made early appearances in plantation revues. In these shows, which had names like <i>In Old Kentucky</i> and sentimentalized the antebellum South, he danced mostly in the virtuosic buck-and-wing style. He soon moved into vaudeville, where he became one of the first African American performers to refuse to wear blackface makeup. <br><br> In 1918, Robinson introduced his signature feat: the stair dance. Using a portable staircase on which each stair sounded at a different pitch, he tapped a dizzying series of constantly varying rhythms. The result was a visually impressive and gloriously multiphonic performance, which Robinson refined to perfection. <br><br> A star turn in the revue <i>Blackbirds of 1928</i> launched Robinson toward the zenith of his professional life. He performed in <i>Harlem Is Heaven</i>, the first film to feature an all-black cast, and made three films with child star Shirley Temple. In 1933, he was named the unofficial “Mayor of Harlem.” <br><br> Robinson’s fame did not mean that he was universally admired. A penchant for gambling and a quick temper marred his reputation. Even more objectionable, to some, was his willingness to play minstrel-like roles for the entertainment of white audiences; the <i>New York Age</i> went so far as to call him an “Uncle Tom.” But Robinson retained the respect of many due to his participation in civic initiatives and his generous charitable contributions, which totaled more than one million dollars."
19,19,James Weldon Johnson,19jwjohnson.jpg,b19jwjohnson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten July 15, 1936</i><br><br> “It is difficult to imagine the Harlem Renaissance without James Weldon Johnson,” the historian John Hope Franklin wrote. Johnson’s almost unfathomably diverse professional life – he was a diplomat, author, lawyer, writer, musician, political activist, and more – rendered him among the foremost contributors to both the artistic and political sides of the movement. <br><br> A native of Jacksonville, Florida, Johnson became an extremely successful songwriter early in his career. He and his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, wrote the seminal “Lift Ev’ry Voice And Sing.” His artistic accomplishments spanned various other genres: he published numerous collections of poetry, and his modernist novel, <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i> (first published anonymously in 1912), is a classic of early-twentieth-century American literature. As an editor and anthologist, Johnson wrote brilliant prefaces to landmark collections of spirituals and African American poetry. Moreover, he mentored younger writers and artists, including Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Countée Cullen, and even a young Gwendolyn Brooks.<br><br>Johnson was also a pioneer in the early civil rights movement. At age 24, he founded a short-lived newspaper, the <i>Daily American</i>, which he characterized as “a strong weapon in the Negro’s defense against racial inequalities and injustices.” By far his most influential position was at the NAACP, where he began as a field secretary in 1917. By 1920, he had ascended to the organization’s top post, and he led antilynching campaigns and other fights for racial justice for more than 20 years. <br><br> These represent only a fraction of Johnson’s many achievements. Among the others: he earned a law degree, translated a libretto for the Metropolitan Opera, served as a diplomat in Venezuela and Nicaragua, wrote lyrics to innumerable popular songs, and served as a professor at New York and Fisk Universities. His untimely death in a car accident in 1938 cut short a life that was astonishing for its record of achievement and enduring impact. "
20,1,Marian Anderson,20anderson.jpg,b20anderson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten January 14, 1940</i><br><br> Marian Anderson’s long career both preceded and outlasted the heyday of the Harlem Renaissance. Born in 1897, she grew up in a middle-class family in Philadelphia, where she sang at the Union Baptist Church and began taking formal voice lessons at age 15. Her talent was recognized immediately, but her professional success in the United States was limited at first. Her career blossomed more fully after she studied and performed in Europe in the early 1930s and, upon her return, began working with the concert manager Sol Hurok. <br><br> The high point of Anderson’s career undoubtedly came when she performed in front of tens of thousands of Americans (and countless others listening on their radios) on Easter Sunday, 1939. After Anderson was denied the opportunity to sing at Constitution Hall due to the racist policies of the Daughters of the American Revolution, an incensed Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for Anderson to perform at the Lincoln Memorial instead. The moment catapulted her to celebrity. Anderson would later write of its import, “I could see that my significance as an individual was small in this affair. I had become, whether I liked it or not, a symbol, representing my people.” <br><br> As both singer and symbol, Anderson continued to make history. In 1955, she became the first African American woman to sing at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, and she has since been the subject of numerous tributes and commemorations. Although Anderson never identified explicitly as an activist for racial justice, her artistry made its own statement. It seems worth noting that during her landmark 1939 performance, Anderson made a subtle but telling alteration to the pronouns of the song “America”: “Of thee we sing.” The change exemplified Anderson’s ability to create a sense of community and solidarity through the unmatched power of her outstanding voice.  "
21,12,Max Eastman,21eastman.jpg,b21eastman.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten October 31, 1934</i><br><br> Max Eastman, a writer, editor, and radical activist, was part of an accomplished family. His mother, Annis Ford, was one of the first American women to be ordained as a minister; his sister, Crystal Eastman, was a leading feminist thinker; and Samuel Clemens (a.k.a. Mark Twain) was a childhood friend. When Eastman moved to New York in 1907 to study philosophy at Columbia University, he became a member of the progressive intellectual community in Greenwich Village. He was a committed feminist, founding the first Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage in 1910. As editor of the socialist magazine <i>The Masses</i> from 1913 to 1917, Eastman took an unpopular stance by opposing U.S. entry into World War I. He and his collaborators were indicted for conspiracy as a result of their position, but they were never jailed. In 1918, Eastman founded <i>The Liberator</i>, a new and similarly radical magazine that he co-edited with his sister, Crystal. <br><br><i> The Liberator</i> promoted the work of African American writers, and Eastman also supported the Harlem Renaissance financially as an active patron. He was especially close with Claude McKay, and he published McKay’s protest poem, “If We Must Die,” as race riots erupted throughout the country in the summer of 1919. McKay became one of <i>The Liberator</i>’s editors in 1922, in which position he urged the magazine to devote more attention to issues of racial justice. <br><br> An admirer of Lenin and Trotsky, Eastman traveled to the Soviet Union in 1922 and became Trotsky’s translator upon returning to the United States in 1927. He was an outspoken anti-Stalinist, publishing multiple books that exposed and analyzed the dictator’s crimes. In later years, Eastman’s political views veered sharply right, and he went so far as to praise the actions of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Eastman died in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1969. "
22,4,Gladys Bentley,22bentley.jpg,b22bentley.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten February 27, 1932</i><br><br> Gladys Bentley was one of the more daring and dazzling figures of the Harlem Renaissance. A large woman who often dressed in a tuxedo or man’s suit and tie, Bentley played piano and sang raucous, energetic, and loud blues songs. <br><br> Growing up in Philadelphia, Bentley knew that her attraction to women made her irreconcilably different from many people around her. She suffered harsh treatment from family, teachers, and even doctors who claimed they could “cure” her. She left home at 16 and moved to Harlem, where she found an underground social culture that included gambling, drug use, and drag shows. In this so-called “sporting life,” Bentley could be an openly lesbian woman without risk of ridicule or abuse. She flaunted her lesbianism by flirting with women in her audiences and talking openly about sexual escapades. Bentley even married a female lover in a very public ceremony. <br><br> Performing at rent parties and in clubs, Bentley became a popular blues singer among Harlem’s fringe community. Langston Hughes described her dynamic style: “Miss Bentley sat, and played a big piano all night long, literally all night, without stopping – singing songs like ‘The St. James Infirmary’ from ten in the evening until dawn, with scarcely a break between the notes, sliding from one song to another, with a powerful continuous underbeat of jungle rhythm.” <br><br> As white patrons started to come uptown to her shows, Bentley began to play the Cotton Club and other mainstream Harlem venues. These less “sporting” audiences didn’t prevent Bentley from singing obscene songs and creating salacious versions of popular tunes. Her style remained vibrant and rowdy. In his novel <i>Parties</i>, Carl Van Vechten modeled a blues performer on Bentley; “when she pounds the piano the dawn comes up like thunder,” he wrote, “say, she rocks the box, and tosses it, you can bet, and jumps it through hoops.”"
23,3,Albert Barnes,23barnes.jpg,b23barnes.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten October 20, 1937</i><br><br> When he was eight years old, Albert Barnes attended a black revival meeting in Mechanicsville, New Jersey and was immediately captivated by the glorious music he heard. “So vivid and so deep” was the experience, he later remembered, that it “influenced [his] whole life,” catalyzing an enduring interest in African American culture. <br><br> Barnes grew up in a white, working-class community in Philadelphia, made a fortune as an inventor and chemist, and used his wealth to found the Barnes Foundation in Merion, Pennsylvania in 1922. There, he established one of the world’s most significant collections of modern and African art. Unlike many white art collectors of his time, he regarded African art as aesthetically valuable in its own right, rather than exclusively as an anthropological curiosity. He was especially interested in African sculpture and its influence upon European modernism, once proclaiming that it was “no exaggeration to claim that the best of what has been developed in contemporary art during the past twenty years owes its origin to the inspiration of primitive Negro sculpture.” Barnes was also fascinated by the connections between African and African American artistic practices. Eager to demonstrate such resonances, he hosted performances of the spirituals by local African American musicians amid the Foundation’s African art galleries. <br><br> Barnes established relationships with several key Harlem Renaissance figures, including Alain Locke, Charles S. Johnson, and James Weldon Johnson. His friendship with Locke was especially notable: the two men met in Paris in 1923, and Locke later invited Barnes to contribute articles on African and African American culture to <i>Opportunity</i>, <i>Survey Graphic</i>, and the landmark anthology <i>The New Negro</i>. Although his relationship with Locke would eventually become antagonistic, Barnes maintained his lifelong interest in black cultural expression, which he regarded as “the greatest art America has produced.”"
24,10,Aaron Douglas,24douglas.jpg,b24douglas.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten April 10, 1933</i><br><br> Aaron Douglas considered the Harlem Renaissance a “magic moment in history,” an unprecedented opportunity for the flourishing of African American culture. As the movement’s leading visual artist, he helped realize this goal. Douglas grew up in Topeka, Kansas and moved to Detroit after high school in search of a stable job. While working at a Cadillac factory, he took free evening art classes at the Detroit Museum of Art. For the next several years, he moved around the Midwest, earning two bachelor’s degrees in the process before taking a job as a high school art teacher. <br><br> Douglas arrived in Harlem in 1925 and rapidly ascended to a position of prominence. Within months of his arrival, he was hired to create cover art for <i>Opportunity</i> and <i>The Crisis</i>. He also became the only African American illustrator for Alain Locke’s landmark anthology, <i>The New Negro</i>, and in 1926, he joined with other young artists to produce the groundbreaking journal <i>Fire!!</i>. Douglas explored the world of book publishing as well, designing dust jackets for works by James Weldon Johnson, Countée Cullen, and Langston Hughes, among others. These books and magazines circulated widely, making Douglas’s art highly visible as the public imagery of the Harlem Renaissance. <br><br> Douglas’s artistic style, which has been described as “Afro-Cubism,” fused African themes and subjects with international modernist aesthetics. His works feature allusions to African masks and sculpture, angular shapes, and flat, silhouette-like figures. These qualities are especially evident in his ambitious murals, which graced the walls of buildings from Harlem’s Club Ebony to the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library. Douglas concluded his exceptionally successful career by teaching for many years at Fisk University, passing on his expertise and knowledge to the next generation."
25,24,George S. Schuyler ,25schuyler.jpg,b25schuyler.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten July 2, 1941</i><br><br> George Schuyler thrived on iconoclasm and controversy. A brilliant journalist, novelist, and satirist, he was proudly and perpetually out of touch with the mainstream political and social currents of his times. Born in 1895, Schuyler served in the Army for several years and was briefly imprisoned for desertion. After moving to New York in 1919, he was hired by labor organizer A. Philip Randolph to work at <i>The Messenger</i>, a socialist magazine. In his regular column, “Shafts and Darts: A Page of Calumny and Satire,” Schuyler lampooned everyone from W. E. B. Du Bois to Marcus Garvey and developed his trademark style. In 1924, Schuyler became a correspondent for the <i>Pittsburgh Courier</i>, where he wrote both satire and editorials. He married Josephine Codgell, a white woman from Texas, in 1931; their daughter Philippa Duke Schuyler was a famous musical prodigy. <br><br> One of Schuyler’s best-known essays, “The Negro Art Hokum,” (1926) was published in <i>The Nation</i> alongside Langston Hughes’s more well-known essay “The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain.” In contrast to Hughes’s conviction that black artists must draw inspiration from the materials of black vernacular culture, Schuyler rejected the very idea that art could be “expressive or characteristic of the Negro race” – a controversial viewpoint in the context of the Harlem Renaissance. In <i>Black No More</i> (1931), a science fiction novel, Schuyler mocked the absurdity of American racial hierarchies by imagining a treatment that would allow black people to become white.<br><br> After World War II, Schuyler’s politics moved sharply right. He became a staunch anticommunist, denounced Martin Luther King, and declared the civil rights movement an anti-American plot. His autobiography, <i>Black and Conservative</i>(1966), details his anti-civil rights, right-wing politics. By the time of his death in 1977, Schuyler was nearly forgotten among African American writers due to the extreme views he had come to espouse."
26,20,Nella Larsen,26larsen.jpg,b26larsen.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten August 17, 1932</i><br><br> The daughter of a white Danish mother and a black West Indian father, Nella Larsen explored issues of racial identity and identification in her groundbreaking novels, <i>Quicksand</i> (1928) and <i>Passing</i> (1929). Along with her contemporary, Zora Neale Hurston, Larsen was one of the most important female voices of the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Chicago, she was educated at Fisk University, the Lincoln Hospital Training Program, and the New York Public Library’s librarian training program. Throughout her writing career, Larsen worked as a nurse and as a children’s librarian.<br><br> Carl Van Vechten was an early supporter of Larsen’s work. He introduced her to his publishers, Blanche and Alfred Knopf, who later issued both her novels. <i>Quicksand</i> was inspired in part by Larsen’s experiences in Harlem, the southern United States, and abroad. The novel’s main character, Helga Crane, is the daughter of a white mother and black father, and her efforts to fit into various white and black communities are unsuccessful. Larsen’s second novel, <i>Passing</i>, is the story of Clare Kendry, a mixed-race woman who passes for white and marries a white man, but eventually feels compelled to spend time with African Americans in Harlem. <i>Passing</i> was not as well-received as <i>Quicksand</i>; nevertheless, many agreed with a review which deemed it “an earnest and courageous attempt to deal with the whole theme, not just part of it selected as suitable for racial defense or propaganda.” <br><br> In spite of her literary success, Larsen went back to nursing and worked at a Brooklyn hospital for 30 years. The success of <i>Quicksand </i> and <i>Passing</i> suggests that had she continued to write, she would likely have developed ever-greater skill. Though her books were out of print for decades, she has regained a reputation as a writer whose work reveals the complexity of her subject with sensitivity and clarity."
27,50,Carl Van Vechten,27vanvechten.jpg,b27vanvechten.jpg,"<i>Self-portrait April 3, 1934</i><br><br> Carl Van Vechten was a champion of African American culture and one of the central figures of the Harlem Renaissance. He befriended, photographed, wrote about, and corresponded with many of the movement’s stars. A generous patron, he provided financial support and connected black writers to prominent publishers. At the same time, Van Vechten wrote a controversial novel about Harlem called <i>Nigger Heaven</i> and attracted criticism for what some saw as a voyeuristic fascination with black life. For these reasons, he remains a controversial figure. <br><br> Van Vechten grew up in Iowa and moved to New York in 1906. His first job in the city was as a music critic at the <i>New York Times</i>; he would go on to write several books of music criticism, as well as many novels. Following a brief first marriage, he married his second wife, the actress Fania Marinoff, in 1914. Their relationship lasted for over 40 years, despite the fact that Van Vechten often had male lovers. <br><br> Van Vechten counted many literary luminaries among his friends. He developed a close relationship with Gertrude Stein, eventually becoming her literary executor. Zora Neale Hurston liked him immensely, once remarking, “If Carl was a people instead of a person, I could then say, ‘These are my people.’” Langston Hughes considered him a mentor, and James Weldon Johnson was a close confidante. Others gave Van Vechten a frostier reception – notably W. E. B. Du Bois, who wrote a scathing review of <i>Nigger Heaven</i>.<br><br> In the 1930s, Van Vechten turned a longtime interest in photography into a profession. He produced nearly 20,000 photographs, including portraits of countless celebrated figures. Another passion was collecting: books, clippings, manuscripts, programs, correspondence, and more. In 1941, his book collection and archive of materials related to African American life became the basis for the James Weldon Johnson Memorial Collection of Negro Arts and Letters."
28,47,Augusta Savage,28savage.jpg,b28savage.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten July 9, 1938</i><br><br> Augusta Savage combined her talent as a sculptor with a commitment to supporting other black artists. A Florida native, Savage nurtured her early creativity by sculpting red clay from her family’s backyard. She moved to New York with only $4.60 to her name and was accepted to study at Cooper Union. In 1923, the art school in Fontainebleau, France awarded her a scholarship and then retracted it following complaints from white students. The incident garnered public attention as black newspapers decried the “color line in art.” <br><br> From 1929 to 1931, Savage studied in Paris. Her sculpture from this period, which includes works like <i>Danseur nu</i> and <i>The Amazon</i>, depicts the black body with detail and dignity. Yet because Savage often could not afford bronze, and worked instead in clay or plaster, many of her sculptures are now lost. <br><br> Returning to Harlem at the height of the Depression, Savage dedicated herself to teaching young African American artists. Her students included Norman Lewis, Ernest Crichlow, and Jacob Lawrence. For years, she provided free instruction from her 143rd Street studio, and in 1937 she opened the Harlem Community Art Center. As a supervisor on the Federal Art Projects, she advocated for increased representation of black artists, helping them obtain much-needed jobs. <br><br><i> The Harp </i> (1939) epitomizes the mixed fortunes of Savage’s career. Commissioned for the World’s Fair in New York and inspired by the anthem “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” the celebrated work was destroyed after the fair because Savage could not afford to preserve it. Her legacy, though, lives on through the network of artists for whom she was a mentor and advocate. ""I have created nothing really beautiful, really lasting,” Savage once reflected, “but if I can inspire one of these youngsters to develop the talent I know they possess, then my monument will be in their work.”"
29,37,J. Rosamond Johnson,29jrjohnson.jpg,b29jrjohnson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten April 22, 1933</i><br><br>In awe of his subject’s stunning “musical versatility,” an early biographer of J. Rosamond Johnson marveled that “he is unclassified.” The characterization proved prescient. Throughout his long career, Johnson flourished as a performer, composer, director, anthologist, arranger, and critic, crossing borders of genre and form at every turn. <br><br> Born in Jacksonville, Florida in 1873, Johnson began playing the piano at age four, gave his first public performance at eight, and held the position of organist at the Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Church by 12. After studying at the New England Conservatory of Music, he toured with the show <i>Oriental America</i>, then returned to Jacksonville to work as a music supervisor for the city’s schools. Later endeavors included a stint as music director at Oscar Hammerstein’s London Opera House, a directorship at the New York Music School Settlement in Harlem, tours with a vaudeville group, performances of the spirituals with the singer Taylor Gordon, and a role as Lawyer Frazier in the premiere of <i>Porgy and Bess</i>.<br><br> In addition to these solo pursuits, Johnson maintained a longstanding partnership with his brother James Weldon Johnson. Their collaboration began in childhood when, James Weldon once recalled, the brothers stood “close by on either side while [our mother] picked out hymns or other simple pieces. It was our great delight, my brother at one end of the keyboard and I at the other, to chime in with what were then wholly futuristic harmonies.” The two brothers worked together to produce <i>The Book of American Negro Spirituals</i>. With the vaudevillian Bob Cole, they also formed a songwriting trio that produced three full-length shows and an astonishing number of popular hits. As Johnson proudly noted, the group’s aim was to “[turn] the tide” in American songwriting from the racist genre of the “coon song” to black-authored “American Story-Songs, ballads, and songs of love.”<br><br> Among Johnson’s many contributions to American musical and cultural life, perhaps the most enduring is “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Written in 1900 for a Jacksonville children’s choir (he composed the music, his brother the lyrics), the song later became known as the official song of the NAACP and the unofficial “Negro National Anthem.” Surely Johnson was correct when he called it “our greatest contribution as a song, that will always live.”"
30,39,Blanche Knopf,30bknopf.jpg,b30bknopf.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten April 4, 1932</i><br><br> A native New Yorker, Blanche Wolf Knopf met her husband, Alfred A. Knopf, in 1911 when he was a senior at Columbia University and an aspiring publisher. Blanche shared Alfred’s ambition to start a publishing house, and they were soon engaged. The two realized their goal in 1915, starting their press with $5,000 from Alfred A. Knopf’s father and space in his New York office. The couple married in 1916. <br><br> In the press’s early years, the Knopfs were involved in all aspects of the publishing process, from soliciting and editing manuscripts to designing and marketing books. From the beginning, Blanche was active in all areas of the business, including designing the Borzoi, a Russian wolfhound imprint marking Knopf titles. Blanche Knopf was soon vice president and director of the already thriving business and she earned a reputation as an influential and powerful editor. Throughout the more than 50 years Knopf worked in publishing, she was a force in shaping the American literary marketplace and the nature of American book publishing. During her tenure with the firm, Knopf published the work of 11 Nobel Prize winners as well as 18 Pulitzer Prize-winning titles. <br><br> Though Blanche Knopf is often associated with the European writers whose work she edited and published—Sigmund Freud, André Gide, Simone de Beauvoir and her close friend Albert Camus—she also worked closely with American writers including Willa Cather, H.L. Mencken, Langston Hughes, and Carl Van Vechten. In the 1920s, Van Vechten encouraged the Knopfs to publish the work of a number of talented African American writers, including Langston Hughes and Nella Larsen. By publishing the work of these influential writers, the Knopfs were important participants in and supporters of the literature of the Harlem Renaissance."
31,42,Rouben Mamoulian,31mamoulian.jpg,b31mamoulian.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten November 7, 1935</i><br><br> Rouben Mamoulian made a lasting impact on American culture as the director of landmark musicals and movies. Born to a wealthy family in Tbilisi, Georgia, he began his career by studying experimental theater in Moscow and directing plays in London. He moved to the United States in 1923, when the philanthropist George Eastman recruited him to work for the newly formed American Opera Company in Rochester, New York. <br><br> Mamoulian’s first major success in the United States was Dubose and Dorothy Heyward’s <i>Porgy</i>, which he directed for the Theater Guild in 1927. Eight years later, he became the director of its wildly popular successor, the Gershwins’ <i>Porgy and Bess</i>. Scholars have recently rediscovered Mamoulian’s significant creative influence on the opera, including the fact that he wrote some of its most memorable lines. <br><br> Mamoulian was also a respected film director. His first movie, <i>Applause</i>(1929), launched a successful run of more than a dozen Hollywood films, many of which made pioneering use of Technicolor and new sound technologies. Both onscreen and on Broadway, Mamoulian focused on synthesizing sound and image in innovative ways. He played a key role in developing the integrated Broadway musical – works that combine music and story into a unified whole. As the director of <i>Oklahoma!</i> (1943) and <i>Carousel</i> (1945), he brought some of the era’s most successful musicals to life. <br><br>Mamoulian’s creative aesthetic, which he called “stylization,” rejected naturalism in favor of highly formalized acting, rhythmic vigor, and visual spectacle. To his mind, this aesthetic had a social purpose. As he once told an interviewer, “The world today is so full of violence, obscenity, war, the failure of political systems. I try to make movies that make people a bit more confident. But that doesn't mean being sugary. A film must have two elements - it must deal with the real world and show how it could be made better.”"
32,31,George Gershwin,32gershwin.jpg,b32gershwin.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten March 28, 1933</i><br><br> George Gershwin described one of his most famous compositions, <i>Rhapsody in Blue</i>, as a “musical kaleidoscope of America, of our vast melting pot, of our unduplicated national pep, of our metropolitan madness.” These words capture the spirit of his music, which offers a vibrant sonic image of early-twentieth-century America. <br><br> Gershwin was a child of a complex, multiracial urban environment: born to Russian Jewish immigrant parents in Brooklyn, he played the piano from an early age and quit high school to work as a song plugger and Broadway rehearsal pianist. Along the way, he devoured a rich array of musical influences, from Tin Pan Alley tunes to French impressionism to the radical twelve-tone compositions of Schoenberg. He often worked in collaboration with his brother Ira, a lyricist. <br><br> African American music was at the heart of Gershwin’s myriad musical endeavors, which ranged from popular song to orchestral works to opera. <i>Blue Monday</i> (1922), an early work, is a small-scale opera about life in Harlem that included white singers in blackface. The perennially popular <i>Rhapsody in Blue </i>(1924) is a masterpiece of hybridity that merges syncopated rhythms with jazz harmonies, klezmer-inspired motifs, and lush melodic gestures. <i>Porgy and Bess</i> (1935) prompted J. Rosamond Johnson to praise Gershwin as “the Abraham Lincoln of Negro music.” Characterized as a “folk opera,” it engendered admiration and criticism in equal measure among contemporary audiences. White theatergoers valued the work for its apparent “authenticity,” while African American critics had a mixed response: many were wary of the way Gershwin employed racial stereotypes, but they also recognized that the opera provided unprecedented performance opportunities for black artists. Despite, or perhaps because of, such controversy, <i>Porgy and Bess</i> became a staple of the American repertoire. Tragically, Gershwin died just two years after the opera’s premiere, succumbing to a brain tumor at the age of 38."
33,43,Rose McClendon,33mcclendon.jpg,b33mcclendon.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten November 19, 1935</i><br><br> Regarded as the “First Lady of the Stage,” Rose McClendon was one of the most celebrated African American actors of her generation. After moving to New York from South Carolina as a child, she gained her first acting experience in church plays. Her breakthrough performance came in 1926, when she received rave reviews for her minor role in <i>Deep River</i> on Broadway. Star turns in Paul Green’s <i>In Abraham’s Bosom</i>, Dubose Heyward’s <i>Porgy</i>, and Langston Hughes’s <i>Mulatto</i> made her the most eminent African American woman on the contemporary stage. The <i>New York Times</i> later noted that “scarcely an important play of Negro life was seen in New York that did not include her in its cast.” <br><br> The question of “what makes a Negro theatre” was at the forefront of McClendon’s professional life. In her view, successful black theater involved not simply the appearance of African Americans on stage, but also “plays that deal with Negroes, with Negro problems, with phases of Negro life, faithfully presented and accurately delineated.” She put these ideas into practice in her own work. A member of the advisory board of the Harlem Experimental Theater, McClendon explored directing and playwriting, co-authoring a play called <i>Taxi Fare</i> with Richard Bruce Nugent in 1931. In 1935, she and Dick Campbell co-founded the Negro People’s Theater, which she deemed “a cultural experiment…based upon a program of social realism.” Their goal was to create space for the establishment of a full-fledged black theatrical tradition. Subsequently, she helped create the Negro Units of the Federal Theater Project, including a Harlem-based unit that employed more than 500 African Americans. Her untimely death from pneumonia in 1936 meant she was never able to realize this goal fully, but her influence lived on through the Rose McClendon Players, which Campbell established in her memory."
34,35,Charles S. Johnson,34csjohnson.jpg,b34csjohnson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten April 25, 1947</i><br><br> Charles S. Johnson has been called an “entrepreneur of the Harlem Renaissance” due to his skill in promoting black cultural achievement and creating opportunities for African American artists and writers. A distinguished sociologist, he was confident in the ability of culture to combat racism and believed that artistic expression represented “the road to a new freedom” for African Americans. <br><br> Born and raised in Virginia, Johnson attended Virginia Union University, a historically black institution, before earning a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Chicago in 1918, studying with Robert Park, a founder of the “Chicago School” of sociology. Following Chicago’s devastating 1919 riot, Johnson became the major author of the report <i>The Negro in Chicago</i>, which analyzed the deep roots of racial violence in the city. <br><br> Johnson moved to New York in 1921 to become research director of the National Urban League. He continued to direct research projects while becoming increasingly involved in the creative milieu of the Harlem Renaissance. In 1923, he founded and became the editor of <i>Opportunity</i>, the League’s journal. <i>Opportunity</i> proved a key platform for African American writers, and its literary contests helped launch the careers of Langston Hughes, Countée Cullen, Zora Neale Hurston, and many others. Johnson also hosted the landmark 1924 Civic Club dinner, which brought together African American literary stars and influential white publishers like Alfred Knopf. In 1928, Johnson left New York to teach at Fisk University; he eventually helped to recruit James Weldon Johnson and Aaron Douglas, as well as other exceptional faculty. In 1946, Johnson became the first African American president of Fisk. <br><br> Johnson maintained a lifelong faith in the power of art and scholarship to bring about social change, and some prominent black intellectuals, including W. E. B. Du Bois, critiqued him for being insufficiently radical in his demands for civil rights. Yet there is no doubt that Johnson made a significant impact through his commitment to scholarly research and his cultivation of black creative talent.  "
35,44,Richard Bruce Nugent,35nugent.jpg,b35nugent.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten February 16, 1936</i><br><br>The artist and writer Richard Bruce Nugent was born in 1906 in Washington, D.C. to a socially elite African American family. After attending the city’s distinguished Dunbar High School, Nugent moved with his family to New York City at the age of 13. There, he worked as a bellhop and art apprentice while studying at the New York School of Industrial Arts and Traphagen School of Fashion. <br><br> A colorful personality and gifted conversationalist, Nugent established connections with many leading figures of the Harlem Renaissance. One of his mentors was Alain Locke, who published Nugent’s short story “Sahdji” in the anthology <i>The New Negro</i> (1925). Along with Langston Hughes, Wallace Thurman, Gwendolyn Bennett, Zora Neale Hurston, and others, Nugent was a major contributor to the short-lived journal <i>Fire!!</i> (1926). Although it folded after only one issue, <i>Fire!!</i> was of enormous symbolic importance. It rejected the conservative attitudes of an older generation of African American artists and their white patrons and declared that the younger generation, unencumbered by tradition, would chart new artistic territory. Nugent contributed two drawings and a short story, “Smoke, Lilies and Jade,” that depicted a romantic relationship between two men. Although certainly not the only gay man to occupy a prominent place in the Harlem Renaissance, Nugent was unusual among African American writers of the era for his openness about his sexuality. <br><br> Nugent was also involved in the performing arts: he appeared in the cast of <i>Porgy</i> (the precursor to <i>Porgy and Bess</i>), joined a ballet company, and danced in Hall Johnson’s “Negro Folk Drama” <i>Run, Little Chillun</i>. Later, he helped found the Harlem Cultural Council and continued to write and paint. During the last decades of his long life – he lived until 1987 – his sharp memory and wealth of brilliant stories made him a key source of firsthand information about the Harlem Renaissance. "
36,48,Noble Sissle,36sissle.jpg,b36sissle.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten November 20, 1951</i><br><br>Noble Sissle wore many musical hats: composer, bandleader, singer, lyricist, and player of the “bandolin” (a banjo-mandolin hybrid). The son of a pastor and schoolteacher, he grew up singing in church choirs and glee clubs in Indianapolis. In 1915, Sissle began a musical partnership with Eubie Blake that would last for more than six decades. Initially, both men worked for James Reese Europe, the leader of New York’s famed Clef Club Orchestra. After Europe’s untimely death in 1918 – he was murdered by a deranged member of his orchestra – Sissle and Blake toured as the Dixie Duo, a vaudeville act. <br><br> The pair’s most significant contribution was the 1921 musical <i>Shuffle Along</i>. Langston Hughes called it the show “that gave a scintillating send-off to that Negro vogue in Manhattan.” The first musical of its era to feature a black cast and creative team, <i>Shuffle Along</i> ran for more than 500 performances. It was so popular that it shut down traffic on the block outside the Sixty-Third Street Theater on account of the teeming crowds gathered outside. Sissle and Blake wrote the score, while comedians Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles wrote the book. If the story, a convoluted tale of a mayoral race in a southern town, did not stand the test of time, the music certainly did. Songs like “I’m Just Wild About Harry” and “Love Will Find A Way” have become standards, and the entire musical was reworked as a Broadway show in 2016. <br><br> Although Sissle and Blake never replicated the success of <i>Shuffle Along</i>, Sissle stayed active on the arts scene as a composer, recording artist, and community leader. In 1937, he became the first elected president of the Negro Actors Guild of America. In 1950, he was named the honorary mayor of Harlem, an indication of the lasting significance of his artistic work. "
37,46,Paul Robeson,37robeson.jpg,b37robeson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten January 10, 1936</i><br><br>Paul Robeson was a citizen-artist who used his voice to fight for justice. Exceptionally talented across a broad array of fields, he rose to international prominence, only to encounter relentless opposition to his radical politics. <br><br> The son of a former slave, Robeson was a star athlete who attended Rutgers on a football scholarship. He married Eslanda Goode, an author and activist, in 1920. Robeson first moved to Harlem to study law at Columbia, but, angered by racial discrimination in the legal profession, he pursued a career in theater instead. His first major roles were in two plays by Eugene O’Neill, <i>The Emperor Jones</i> and <i>All God’s Chillun Got Wings</i> in 1924. In 1930, he achieved a stunning success as the first black actor since Ira Aldridge to portray Othello when he performed the role opposite Peggy Ashcroft at the Savoy Theatre in London. Robeson’s inimitable singing – one critic described his as “a voice in which deep bells ring” – earned him further acclaim, especially for his performances of the spirituals and his signature song, “Ol’ Man River,” from the Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein musical <i>Show Boat</i>.<br><br> When Robeson moved to Europe in the 1930s, he began to speak out vociferously against racism, fascism, and colonialism, and in favor of the Soviet Union. He used his celebrity to put pressure on American political leaders in the early years of the civil rights movement. But as rising anticommunist hysteria took hold in the United States, Robeson became one of its most visible victims. He was investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee for his suspected ties to Communism, and in 1950 the State Department revoked his passport – a devastating blow that shattered his ability to earn an income. <br><br> Robeson once declared that artists “are the gatekeepers of truth. We are civilization’s radical voice.” He remained committed to this belief throughout his career. Yet years of hostility and intimidation took their toll on his physical and psychological health. Robeson retired from public life in 1963, living as a private citizen in Philadelphia until his death in 1976."

She spent several years as managing editor of the <i>Tattler</i>, a New York City newspaper that gave accounts of African American high society in Harlem, Chicago, and other cities.<br><br> Major graduated from the University of Chicago, married a doctor, and worked briefly as a teacher. During World War I, she was a major in the Red Cross. Eventually, Major left her husband, moved from Chicago to Harlem, and found her “true vocation, . . . delineating the social scene in a series of columns.”<br><br> Major was a regular at A’Lelia Walker’s salon, known as The Dark Tower, and her accounts of the comings and goings of Harlem’s artistic and intellectual set at these affairs were read widely. Glamorous and lovely, Major held many parties of her own and was sometimes referred to as “Harlem’s Hostess.” In 1928, Major opened the Geraldyn Dismond Bureau of Specialized Publicity, on 135th Street. She gave herself the title “Publicity Agent.” <br><br> In addition to her society journalism and work as a publicity specialist, Major was also a radio announcer. She became the first African American woman to host a regular show. Her program, “The Negro Achievement Hour,” aired first on WABC and later appeared on other area stations."
39,38,Alfred A. Knopf,39knopf.jpg,b39knopf.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten March 31, 1935</i><br><br> Publisher Alfred A. Knopf was a major figure in the development of twentieth-century American literature. He and his wife, Blanche Wolf Knopf, met at Columbia University in 1911 and were married five years later. With the help of Alfred’s father, a successful advertising executive, the couple founded a publishing house in New York in 1915. They would both continue to work in publishing for over 50 years, shaping the course of American literary life. <br><br> Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. initially focused on publishing European and other international literature in translation, including works by authors from France, Russia, Lebanon, China, Sweden, Poland, and Norway. Their purview soon expanded to American writers, among them H. L. Mencken, Langston Hughes, and Willa Cather. The Knopf firm was additionally notable for its innovative approach to graphic design: rather than featuring a standardized design, dust jackets were designed to resonate with a particular book’s content. In this way, each physical book became a work of art in its own right. In partnership with Mencken, Alfred Knopf also founded the magazine <i>American Mercury</i> in 1925. <br><br> Knopf worked closely with a number of African American writers. He introduced his close friend, Carl Van Vechten, to Walter White; Van Vechten, in turn, introduced Knopf to writers including Langston Hughes and Nella Larsen. In 1927, Knopf republished James Weldon Johnson’s <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i> with bold cover art by Aaron Douglas. The book had originally been released anonymously, and its reissue in the peak years of the Harlem Renaissance helped to revivify Johnson’s literary career. These business relationships were often social as well: Langston Hughes remembered that “For several pleasant years, [Van Vechten] gave an annual birthday party for James Weldon Johnson, young Alfred A. Knopf, Jr., and himself, for their birthdays fell on the same day.” "
40,32,Nora Holt,40holt.jpg,b40holt.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten October 26, 1934</i><br><br> Nora Holt’s reputation is misleading; she was much more than just a rich party girl whose escapades were a staple of gossip columns. An accomplished singer and serious scholar of music, she was the first African American to earn a master of music degree. She also helped found the National Association of Negro Musicians, briefly published a magazine entitled <i>Music and Poetry</i>, and served as music critic for the <i>Chicago Defender</i>.<br><br> In spite of these successes, around Harlem in the 1920s Holt was known as a wild socialite who lived high on her inherited fortune. Her many marriages—Holt was named in <i>Ebony</i>’s 1949 article “Most Married Negroes”—attracted gossip, even among her friends. When she married Joseph L. Ray in 1923, the society papers described in detail Holt’s diamond earrings (six carats in each ear) and pearl-beaded dress. Carl Van Vechten was so taken with Holt that he used her as the model for Lasca Sartoris, a character in his controversial novel <i>Nigger Heaven</i>. Like Holt, Lasca Sartoris was a beautiful and wild young woman, a constant subject of conversation. <br><br> After years in Harlem, Holt moved to California, where she taught music in public high schools and owned a beauty parlor. She returned to New York in the 1940s and became a music critic first for the <i>Amsterdam News</i>, then for the <i>New York Courier</i>. Throughout the 1950s, and until her death in 1974, Holt remained an influential critic, producing and hosting radio programs highlighting the work of African American artists."
41,27,Richmond Barthé,41barthe.jpg,b41barthe.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten September 23, 1939</i><br><br> Alain Locke admired the sculptor Richmond Barthé, his friend and protégé, for his “lifelong interest in the beauty and special idiom of Negro types.” Barthé, Locke wrote, “has taken us in all our variegated but yet very characteristic variety,” producing “the best documentation of the Negro in sculpture to date.” This generous assessment was shared by many of their contemporaries. By the late 1930s, he was the most widely exhibited black artist in the United States. Some of his best-known sculptures, such as those of Touissant L’Ouverture and Paul Robeson, depict iconic historic and contemporary personalities. Others, like <i>African Dancer</i> and <i>Blackberry Woman</i>, portray anonymous figures. <br><br> Barthé’s aesthetics were shaped by the intersections of his identity as a gay, Catholic artist of Creole heritage. He had a special affinity for the black male nude, a form he returned to over the course of his career. He also invoked religious subjects frequently, and often sculpted actors and dancers in a way that emphasized their movement, vibrancy, and dynamism. <br><br> Movement was as fundamental to Barthé’s life as it was to his art. Born in Mississippi and raised in New Orleans, he studied at the Art Institute of Chicago before moving to New York in 1929. There, he chose to set up his studio near Greenwich Village rather than Harlem, a decision that irked some fellow black artists, but also facilitated his fluid movement between the two neighborhoods’ divergent social circles. In 1949, at the height of his success in the United States, Barthé moved to Jamaica. His career continued to flourish, particularly after the Haitian government commissioned him to create several large-scale public works. After 20 years in the Caribbean, he journeyed to Switzerland, Spain, Italy, and, finally, California, where he died in 1989. "
42,40,Alain Leroy Locke,42locke.jpg,b42locke.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten July 23, 1941</i><br><br> Alain Locke was an eminent public intellectual and a key architect of the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Philadelphia, Locke was an outstanding student who trained as an academic philosopher. As an undergraduate at Harvard, he studied with William James, George Santayana, and Josiah Royce. He later attended Oxford as the first African American Rhodes Scholar, returning to Harvard to earn a Ph.D. in 1918. A prolific scholar, he wrote on wide-ranging topics including critical pragmatism, aesthetics, value theory, pluralism, and philosophy of race. He also pursued a long and distinguished teaching career at Howard University. <br><br> Yet Locke is best known not as a philosopher, but as the “Dean of the Harlem Renaissance.” His signature contribution was to edit and publish <i>The New Negro: An Interpretation</i>. Published in 1925, the anthology epitomizes the diversity and vibrancy of the cultural moment. Its 38 contributors include many notable names: Aaron Douglas, Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston, Jessie Fauset, Countée Cullen, James Weldon Johnson, and W. E. B. Du Bois. <i>The New Negro</i> also exemplifies the idea that a “Talented Tenth” – a coterie of skilled artists and writers – could represent an entire racial group. This concept was later critiqued as elitist and exclusionary. <br><br> There is no doubt, though, that <i>The New Negro</i> stands as an essential text of the Harlem Renaissance, and Locke as one of its most important participants. In his introductory essay to the volume, Locke summed up the grand significance of the phrase “New Negro” and the cultural moment he considered absolutely vital to the American future: <br><blockquote> The younger generation is vibrant with a new psychology; the new spirit is awake in the masses, and under the very eyes of the professional observers is transforming what has been a perennial problem into the progressive phases of contemporary Negro life. </blockquote>"
43,52,Elisabeth Welch,43welch.jpg,b43welch.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten January 19, 1933</i><br><br> Like many African American performers of her time, singer Elisabeth Welch found greater success in Europe than in the United States. After starting her career in New York, Welch performed in popular clubs in Paris and London, and, later, in British films. Before leaving New York, however, Welch made her Broadway debut in the 1923 musical <i>Runnin’ Wild</i>, singing “Charleston,” the “theme song of the jazz age.” Welch was still in high school at the time.<br><br> After singing for years in European clubs and shows, Welch returned to New York to a club called the Royal Box in 1930. While performing there, she sang Cole Porter’s “Love for Sale,” a song featured in <i>The New Yorkers</i>, which had just opened on Broadway to mixed reviews. A friend of Porter’s heard Welch’s performance and convinced <i>The New Yorkers</i>’ producers to replace the white actress who sang the song in the show’s opening with Welch. “Love for Sale” became one of Welch’s most popular songs, and her performance in the New York production of the musical was the first of many appearances she would make in Porter’s productions. It also marked the beginning of a long friendship with Cole Porter.<br><br> Welch, who trained as a social worker before committing to a career in the theater, returned to England, where she enjoyed a long and varied career including work in the theater, on the radio, and in films. During World War II, she performed for British troops as a member of Sir John Gielgud’s company. Welch returned to New York in 1980 to appear in <i>Black Broadway</i>, a tribute to twentieth-century African American theater in New York City."
44,33,Langston Hughes,44hughes.jpg,b44hughes.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten March 8, 1939</i><br><br> Unceasingly adventurous, powerfully influential, and always eclectic, Langston Hughes was among the most important writers of the Harlem Renaissance. He worked in virtually every genre, from poetry and short stories to journalism and opera libretti. No matter the medium, he was deeply attentive to the political implications of literary work, both his own and that of other black writers. <br><br> Hughes made his literary mark with the publication of “The Negro Speaks of Rivers” in <i>The Crisis</i> in 1921, when he was only 19 years old. The poem’s sophistication and historical resonance attracted the attention of W. E. B. Du Bois and Jessie Fauset, both of whom helped bolster Hughes’s reputation. With the help of Carl Van Vechten, Hughes published his first book of poetry, <i>The Weary Blues</i>, in 1926. His unprecedented ability to translate the rhythms and feelings of jazz and blues into poetic form – Van Vechten noted the work’s “highly deceptive air of spontaneous improvisation” – garnered widespread acclaim. <br><br> Though rooted in the African American experience, Hughes’s writing was also influenced by his international travels, which enabled him to connect life in the U.S. to global struggles against oppression. In 1923, he left New York on an Africa-bound freighter and eventually ended up in Paris, where he worked in a nightclub kitchen. Later, he traveled to the Soviet Union to contribute to a film about U.S. race relations (1932) and served as a war correspondent for the <i>Baltimore Afro-American</i> in Spain (1937). <br><br> In the 1926 essay “The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,” Hughes offered a manifesto that captured the essence of his artistic vision. He exhorted black artists to resist the “urge…toward whiteness” and celebrate the richness of black vernacular culture: “Let Paul Robeson singing ‘Water Boy,’ and Rudolph Fisher writing about the streets of Harlem, and Jean Toomer holding the heart of Georgia in his hands, and Aaron Douglas's drawing strange black fantasies cause the smug Negro middle class to turn from their white, respectable, ordinary books and papers to catch a glimmer of their own beauty.” "
45,29,Miguel Covarrubias,45covarrubias.jpg,b45covarrubias.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten October 30, 1932</i><br><br> An artist who specialized in portraits and caricatures, Miguel Covarrubias was self-taught and extremely talented. When he moved from Mexico City to Harlem in 1923, the magazine <i>American Mercury</i> reported that he was dazzled by “the color, the rhythm, the incomparable vitality of Negro life, especially as it exists in the theatres, on the streets, in the cabarets.” He immediately became a favorite of magazine editors, and his art appeared in <i>Vanity Fair</i>, <i>The New Yorker</i>, and <i>Vogue</i>.<br><br> Covarrubias became part of the Harlem Renaissance largely via his relationships with white patrons, including Charlotte Osgood Mason and Carl Van Vechten. He contributed illustrations to Alain Locke’s <i>The New Negro</i> and created cover art for books by Langston Hughes, Taylor Gordon, and Zora Neale Hurston. His caricatures of African Americans, which he collected in the 1927 volume <i>Negro Drawings</i>, exaggerated their subjects’ racialized features and tended to portray certain “types”: musicians, dancers, waiters, and so on. Among African American critics, his work attracted a great deal of controversy: Langston Hughes admired him as “the only artist I know whose Negro things have a Blues touch about them,” while W. E. B. Du Bois once wrote, “I think I could exist quite happily if Covarrubias had never been born.”<br><br> Covarrubias’s longstanding interest in folk art gradually blossomed into a broader inquiry into culture and anthropology. He and his wife, the Broadway actress Rosa Rolanda, traveled to Bali on their honeymoon in 1930; he returned there several more times before publishing the bestselling anthropological study <i>Island of Bali</i> in 1937. His subsequent work, on indigenous peoples in Mexico and pre-Columbian art, was the result of years of scholarly research. In the late 1930s, Covarrubias returned to Mexico to teach at the National School of Anthropology and History."
46,53,Walter White,46white.jpg,b46white.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten July 12, 1938</i><br><br>Walter White made a lasting impact on the early civil rights movement through his leadership of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He was born in Atlanta to formerly enslaved parents who ensured that their seven children each received an excellent education. After graduating from Atlanta University in 1916, White began a local chapter of the NAACP in his hometown. He was soon recruited by James Weldon Johnson to move to New York City and become an assistant secretary for the organization in 1918. Although initially skeptical of pursuing a career in activism, White quickly came to find value in the work. By 1931, he had ascended to the NAACP’s top post of executive secretary – a position he would retain until his death in 1955. <br><br> White’s light skin tone, blond hair, and blue eyes – he wrote in his autobiography that the “traits of my race are nowhere visible upon me” – meant that he could pass as white. Taking advantage of his appearance, he often risked his life by going undercover to investigate lynchings and other acts of antiblack violence. His work allowed the NAACP to access otherwise unknowable details of these violent acts, and White reported his disturbing findings in the organization’s official magazine, <i>The Crisis</i>. In addition to antilynching activism, the NAACP also made pioneering strides during White’s tenure toward the elimination of all-white primaries, poll taxes, and de jure segregation. <br><br> Like many prominent African American leaders of the era, White was deeply involved in cultural politics as well. He authored several books with political resonances. These included the novel <i>Fire in the Flint</i> (1924), which described the lynching of a black physician, and the nonfiction work <i>A Rising Wind</i> (1945), which detailed acts of discrimination against black soldiers during World War II.

47,34,Harold Jackman,47jackman.jpg,b47jackman.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten September 11, 1932</i><br><br> Harold Jackman is often remembered for his close friendships with prominent writers, especially the poet Countée Cullen, and for being “the handsomest man in Harlem.” Yet as a teacher, arts patron, writer, model, and collector, Jackman was also a significant figure in his own right. <br><br> Born in London to a Barbadian mother and German father, Jackman emigrated to New York as a young child. He was in high school when he met Cullen, with whom he would remain dear friends until Cullen’s death in 1946. The two men were so close that when Jackman accompanied Cullen on his honeymoon after Cullen’s marriage to Yolande Du Bois (W. E. B. Du Bois’s daughter), tongue-in-cheek newspaper headlines proclaimed “Groom Sails With Best Man.” Although neither man was openly gay, both Cullen and Jackman were part of Harlem’s underground queer community, and Jackman often attended the legendary Hamilton Lodge Balls, “drag balls” which took place throughout the 1920s. <br><br> Jackman was ensconced in the artistic circles of the Harlem Renaissance. He inspired characters in Carl Van Vechten’s controversial novel <i>Nigger Heaven</i> and Wallace Thurman’s <i>Infants of the Spring</i>. A prolific letter writer, he corresponded with a variety of artists, including Gwendolyn Bennett, Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston. He also worked as a model, directed a play by Georgia Douglas Johnson, and contributed to literary journals including <i>New Challenge</i> and <i>Phylon</i>. All the while, he worked as a social studies teacher in the New York City public schools for over 30 years. <br><br> Jackman assisted Van Vechten in compiling materials for the James Weldon Johnson Memorial Collection at Yale University, and he also established the Countée Cullen-Harold Jackman Memorial Collection at Clark Atlanta University. His dedication to documenting and collecting African American culture was perhaps his most influential and enduring contribution. "
48,49,Arthur Spingarn,48spingarn.jpg,b48spingarn.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten January 26, 1940</i><br><br> Lawyer and activist Arthur Spingarn was a leading voice in the struggle for civil rights. A native New Yorker and member of a prominent Jewish family, he attended law school at Columbia University. From the beginning of his legal career, he prioritized the issue of racial justice, and he was unusual among white Americans in his early support of W. E. B. Du Bois’s then-radical demands for black civil rights. During World War I, Spingarn served as a captain in the U.S. Army, in which capacity he protested discriminatory treatment of African American soldiers. <br><br> In 1911, Spingarn was appointed vice president of the NAACP and chairman of its national legal committee, which aimed to combat “injustice in the courts as it affects the Negro.” He helped craft the group’s legal strategy, which focused on challenging racial discrimination in education, housing, and employment. His brother, Joel Elias Spingarn, was also a dedicated activist and NAACP leader who served as chairman of the board and treasurer before becoming the organization’s president. Arthur Spingarn succeeded Joel as president in 1940, and continued to serve in that position until 1966. For 49 years, Arthur Spingarn also worked pro bono as W. E. B. Du Bois’s personal lawyer. <br><br> Both Spingarn brothers were deeply interested in literature and culture, and he actively supported the work of black writers and artists during the Harlem Renaissance. Joel and his wife Amy Spingarn sponsored annual literary prizes given by <i>The Crisis</i>. From 1931 until 1968, Arthur wrote an annual review of books by African American authors for <i>The Crisis</i>. An avid book collector, he joined bibliographic societies in London, Oxford, Cambridge, and Virginia. In 1965, he sold his extensive collection of books, pamphlets and other writings related to the African American experience to Howard University. These materials became the basis for the Moorland-Spingarn Research Center, one of the most important archives of black culture in the United States. "
49,36,Hall Johnson,49halljohnson.jpg,b49halljohnson.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten May 14, 1947</i><br><br> Hall Johnson pursued a multifaceted musical career as a composer, choral director, arranger, and violinist. Inspired to play the violin after hearing a recital by Joseph Douglass (the grandson of Frederick Douglass), he studied music in college and moved to New York in 1910 to become a professional violinist. Opportunities abounded for a skilled young musician: Johnson joined orchestras led by James Reese Europe and Will Marion Cook, opened a music studio, and played in pit orchestras for <i>Shuffle Along</i> and <i>Runnin’ Wild</i>. With Felix Weir, Arthur Boyd, and Marion Cumbo, he became the founding violist of the acclaimed Negro String Quartet in 1923. Johnson was also an accomplished composer, and his musical <i>Run Little Chillun</i> (1933) ran on Broadway for four months. <br><br> The cornerstone of Johnson’s musical life was the African American spiritual. He first heard these songs as a child in Athens, Georgia – his mother and his grandmother, who had both been slaves, sang them often. In 1925, Johnson founded the Hall Johnson Negro Choir, which specialized in preserving the spirituals. He later wrote of the group’s mission: “Its principal aim was not entertainment…Even then, in 1925, I saw clearly that, with the changing times, in a few years, any spirituals remaining, would be found only in the libraries – and nobody would know how to sing them.” The choir immediately found themselves in demand around New York, and they achieved national recognition when they performed in the Broadway play <i>Green Pastures</i> in 1930. Under Johnson’s direction, they went on to make acclaimed recordings, and they appeared in several Hollywood films. <br><br> Generations of singers, from Marian Anderson to Leontyne Price to Kathleen Battle, have continued to perform and record Johnson’s arrangements. In this way, his dream of preserving the spirituals lives on."
50,51,Ethel Waters,50waters.jpg,b50waters.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten June 8, 1932</i><br><br> A vibrant and versatile performer, Ethel Waters earned fame in Harlem nightclubs, on Broadway stages, and in Hollywood films. Her long list of accomplishments includes many “firsts”—she was the first African American to perform on the radio, the first to star with an all-white cast in a Broadway show, and the first to perform with white co-stars in the Deep South. <br><br> Waters’s childhood was difficult and often unhappy. After making a living as a domestic worker, she began singing in clubs and joined a stage show in Baltimore, billed as “Sweet Mama Stringbean.” Waters distinguished herself from other popular blues singers of the day, such as Bessie Smith and Ma Rainey, by performing in a restrained, controlled manner that was unlike others’ open, sweeping vocal style. <br><br> Like other African American performers, Waters encountered the horrific effects of Jim Crow. After a terrible car accident in Alabama, white doctors gave her only minimal treatment, and she was unable to walk for nearly two months. In spite of a difficult recovery, she began to appear in popular Harlem clubs and to develop a following among their elite clientele. <br><br> Of Waters’s first major show, <i>Africana</i>, one critic wrote, “Miss Waters is a maiden of considerable personality, an all-engulfing smile and complete combination between eye and limb and admirers out front.” In 1950, she starred on Broadway in <i>Member of the Wedding</i>, which many considered her finest performance. A few years later, Waters, who had always been a spiritual woman, toured with the Billy Graham Crusade. She found evangelical performing rewarding and sang with Graham’s choir for many years.<br><br>Ethel Waters heavily influenced those who followed her, including Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. Many of her signature songs— “Stormy Weather,” “St. Louis Blues,” and “His Eye Is on the Sparrow”—remain popular with jazz fans today."
51,45,Eugene O'Neill,51oneill.jpg,b51oneill.jpg,"<i>Photographed by Van Vechten September 5, 1933</i><br><br> American dramatist Eugene O’Neill was one of the most significant playwrights of the twentieth century. The son of James O’Neill, a celebrated actor, and Ella Quinlan, he was born into the world of the theater. <i>Long Day’s Journey Into Night</i>, widely considered his best play, dramatizes the challenges of his unstable childhood: his mother’s addiction to morphine, his father’s unfulfilled artistic ambitions, his brother’s alcoholism, and his own aimlessness. <br><br> After briefly attending Princeton, O’Neill set out on what he called “a seeking flight” that took him to Honduras, Argentina, and England. After years of instability and poor health, he began to take playwriting seriously around 1916. When his play <i>Beyond the Horizon</i> won a Pulitzer Prize and critical acclaim in 1920, O’Neill’s life and career entered a new phase. Other accolades followed: three additional Pulitzers, a gold medal from the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature. Yet his path was never a smooth one. Alongside his many professional successes, he continued to battle alcoholism, illness, and a tumultuous personal life. <br><br> O’Neill had a complex relationship to the world of the Harlem Renaissance due to his plays’ provocative treatment of blackness. He was pioneering among white playwrights in his willingness to cast African Americans in serious roles, and actors like Paul Robeson and Charles Gilpin rose to fame by appearing in works like <i>The Emperor Jones</i> (1920) and <i>All God’s Chillun Got Wings</i> (1923). At the same time, his plays often relied upon harmful racial stereotypes. African American intellectuals were divided on the merits of his work: W. E. B. Du Bois praised O’Neill for “bursting through” the limits of race and doing “work that must be done,” while an incredulous Langston Hughes asked, “who wanted <i>The Emperor Jones</i> running through the jungles? Not Harlem!”  "
52,28,Gwendolyn Bennett,52bennett.jpg,b52bennett.jpg,"<i>Bennett was never photographed by Carl Van Vechten; photograph of Bennett in 1922 from the Claude McKay Collection</i><br><br> A multitalented artist and prominent social figure, Gwendolyn Bennett had her finger on the pulse of the Harlem Renaissance. According to one of her biographers, she “seemingly could do anything and everything”: paint, draw, write, teach, and more. Born in Giddings, Texas in 1902, she had a tumultuous childhood and eventually settled in New York, where she attended Brooklyn Girls’ High School and studied the fine arts at Columbia University and the Pratt Institute. Immediately after graduating, she was hired to teach art at Howard University. <br><br> By 1924, Bennett was already an esteemed artist and poet. Although just 22 years old, she garnered an invitation to Charles S. Johnson’s famed Civic Club dinner, where she socialized with African American literary luminaries. She spent the following year studying art in Paris, but soon returned to Harlem. In 1926, she began her career at the magazine <i>Opportunity</i>, for which she served as literary editor, produced cover art, and wrote a column, “The Ebony Flute.” Focused on what Bennett called “literary chit-chat and artistic whatnot,” “The Ebony Flute” highlighted new work by African American writers and celebrated the vitality of black cultural production. Bennett also published both poetry and prose. Her best-known works include the poem “Heritage,” published in <i>The Crisis</i> in 1923, and the short story “Wedding Day,” published in the short-lived <i>Fire!!</i> in 1926. Her work was also anthologized in Countée Cullen’s <i>Caroling Dusk</i>, the second edition of James Weldon Johnson’s <i>The Book of American Negro Poetry</i> and other major volumes. <br><br> By the 1930s, Bennett had faded from prominence as a writer, but she stayed active in the arts realm as director of the Harlem Community Art Center and president of the Harlem Artists’ Guild. She retired to Pennsylvania in 1968, where she opened an antique shop with her husband."
53,30,Jessie Fauset,53fauset.jpg,b53fauset.jpg,"<i>Fauset was never photographed by Carl Van Vechten; photograph of Fauset in 1927 from the Langston Hughes Papers</i><br><br> Jessie Fauset exerted a powerful influence on the literature of the Harlem Renaissance through both her own writing and her support of other authors. A native of Philadelphia, she was the first black woman to graduate from Cornell University. She began her career as a high school teacher in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., where she taught at the renowned M Street High School. <br><br> Fauset devoted much of her literary career to <i>The Crisis</i>, the official magazine of the NAACP. She made her first contribution to the magazine, a column called “What To Read,” in 1912, and continued to publish articles, poems, fiction, and essays in its pages for nearly 20 years. In 1919, W. E. B. Du Bois invited her to move to New York City to become the magazine’s literary editor. In this position, Fauset published the work of Langston Hughes, Countée Cullen, Claude McKay, and others. Hughes would later describe her as one of a group of editors who “midwifed the so-called New Negro literature into being. Kind and critical – but not too critical – they nursed us along until our books were born.”<br><br> As a novelist, Fauset perceptively tackled issues of race, gender, and class. Her first novel, <i>There Is Confusion</i> (1924), details a mixed-race woman’s response to racism and sexism as she seeks to become an artist; Du Bois called it “the novel that the Negro intelligentsia have been clamoring for.” In <i>Plum Bun</i> (1926), protagonist Angela Murray considers passing for white, but ultimately decides that she prefers to identify as “on the coloured side.” <br><br> Critical perspectives on Fauset’s novels have changed dramatically over the years. While she was acclaimed during her lifetime, a later generation dismissed her writing as melodramatic and unadventurous. Only recently have critics come to appreciate the sharpness of her social critique and the complexity of her characters."
